Soochang And Jodi's Adventure

In a world rife with dangerous foe, 
there live two brave heroes, Soochang and Jodi,
who must travel through the land to rescue their 
Professor. A dark force, Turok, was 
wrongly graded by this Professor, and gathered forces 
from the evil depths of the Underworld to kidnap him. 
The two heroes must trekk for many days, battling 
dangerous outwordly creatures. They avoid 
an untimely death by collecting hearts and fruit 
along the way to boost their energy. Keys will be found 
to unlock doors placed by the Evil Turok so the heroes may 
continue on their Quest.
They must save the Professor to receive a grade for 
their final project and pass the course!
